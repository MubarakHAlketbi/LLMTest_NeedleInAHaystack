The best I can say is that the essay suggests doing something you genuinely enjoy and find meaningful, rather than what others think you should do or what seems prestigious. But it doesn't provide specific recommendations for San Francisco activities.", "score": 1, "test_duration_seconds": 12.166794538497925, "test_timestamp_utc": "2024-09-06 19:49:52+0000", "file_name": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620_len_71057_depth_400"}
